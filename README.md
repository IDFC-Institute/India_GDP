GDP: An estimate of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) Derived from satellite Data.
Collection of data on economic variables, especially sub-national income levels,
is problematic, due to various shortcomings in the data collection process.
Additionally, the informal economy is often excluded from official statistics.
Nighttime lights satellite imagery and the Land Scan population grid provide an
alternative means for measuring economic activity.
